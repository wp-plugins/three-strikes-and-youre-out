Closes comments across the board to IP addresses that are behaving badly.

== Description ==

Three Strikes and You're Out examines your Bad Behavior logs and your WordPress
spam queue and closes comments on all blog entries across the board to IP
addresses that have reported three or more attempts at mischief over the past
seven days.

It also has an additional logging feature and an API that allows other plugins
to register certain events as being mischievous.

== Installation ==

* Copy the file `three-strikes.php` to your `/wp-content/plugins` directory.
* Activate it in your WordPress dashboard.

== Configuration ==

By default, Three Strikes and You're Out closes comments right across the board
on your blog to any IP address that has attempted any mischief three or more
times in the past week. You can change these by editing the two defined
constants at the top of the plugin file, just below the copyright notice. There
are three such defines:

* `THREE_STRIKES_LIMIT` is the number of bad hits at which to block comments.
* `THREE_STRIKES_TIMEOUT` is the time in seconds after which bad hits are no
longer considered.
* `THREE_STRIKES_BB_STRICT` indicates that you should consider any "strict"
events recorded in the Bad Behavior log. These are events that are blocked when
Bad Behavior is using the "strict checking" option, but would be ignored
otherwise.

== The Three Strikes API ==

This plugin includes a number of hooks that allow other plugins to communicate
with it. These are implemented as actions and filters, so if Three Strikes is
not installed, your plugin will continue to function.
